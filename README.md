## Introduction

Stock price forecasting is a crucial task for investors, traders, and financial analysts to make informed decisions. In this project, we focus on predicting the future stock prices of Google using two different approaches: ARIMA and LSTM.

## Data

We utilized historical daily stock price data of Google obtained from [source]. The dataset spans from [start date] to [end date] and includes [number of data points] data points.

## Methodology

### ARIMA

ARIMA is a classical time series forecasting technique that models the relationship between a series of observations and lags of the series itself.

### LSTM

LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is well-suited for sequence prediction problems due to its ability to capture long-term dependencies.
